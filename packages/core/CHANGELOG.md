### Patch Changes

- [#33](https://github.com/ieedan/implement/pull/33) [`aee1296`](https://github.com/ieedan/implement/commit/aee129639e5d4f04d3285c017c42fa3649fab48b) Thanks [@ieedan](https://github.com/ieedan)! - Clear a list with one range deletion instead of one removal per row. `ForEach` emptying ten thousand rows made ten thousand `removeChild` calls; the rows are contiguous, so one range deletion takes them all. Partial removals are unaffected.

- [#32](https://github.com/ieedan/implement/pull/32) [`b5c6c3e`](https://github.com/ieedan/implement/commit/b5c6c3e9983ca1d04db41377266a81691a477e66) Thanks [@ieedan](https://github.com/ieedan)! - Publish the node-authoring API and extract the router.

  `@implementjs/core` gains `Outlet`, a swappable mount region whose children are mounted
  through core — so context lookups, error boundaries, hydration and server rendering all
  work inside one — and `location`, the current `RouterLocation` as a `Readable`. Core also
  restores the scroll position of the entry a reload landed on off the first location
  subscription, so a hand-written router gets that for free.

  `Router` moves to the new `@implementjs/router`, written against that public API and
  nothing else. `@implementjs/core/router` is gone; navigation stays in core (`location`,
  `navigateTo`, `searchParam`, the navigation guards and the resolver).

  kit generates `import { Router } from "@implementjs/router"` and takes it as a dependency,
  and scaffolded kit apps list it too — generated code resolves from the app, not from kit.
